        <h3>Main reason that leads to Global Warming</h3>
           <p>The earth would originally absorb 49% of solar radiation after reflecting off the earthâ€™s surface and the atmosphere. After the industrial revolution, mankind used fossil fuels in large quantities to produce many greenhouse gases of carbon dioxide, Absorbing long-wavelength radiation and greatly increasing the solar radiation absorbed by the earth is the so-called "greenhouse "Effect" is the cause of global warming.</p>

        <h3>Sources of CO2 emissions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Power generation: most power plants use fossil fuels, after burning produce carbon dioxide.</li>
            <li>Transportation: When a vehicle is running, it emits carbon dioxide due to fuel.</li>
            <li>Industry: Mainly come from industrial activities in developed countries and release carbon dioxide.</li>
            <li>Buildings: use electricity and fuel to produce heating, cooling, lighting and power.</li>
            <li>Forests: The forests that have been cut down at present will reduce the storage capacity of carbon dioxide by 1/4.</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>The impact of global warming</h3>
        <p>Global warming has affected many natural ecology and biological systems in the world. The changes that have been observed include the destruction of natural environments such as glaciers, coral reefs, mangroves, cold tropical forests, polar regions and alpine systems. In addition, droughts and floods frequently occur in some places, which are also considered to be related to global warming.
turn off. Global warming will bring about more and more extreme weather events, which will affect all aspects of society, economy and environment.</p>

         <h3>The impact of global warming on humans</h3>
         <ol>
             <li>Rising sea level: causing seawater intrusion, reducing land area, and impacting aquaculture fisheries.</li>
             <li>Agricultural impact: increased carbon dioxide concentration will affect the harvest of rice, cucumber and other crops; talk about
Reduction will reduce the corn harvest.</li>
             <li>Rainfall changes: Due to the impact of global warming, it is estimated that the total rainfall in winter will be reduced by 5-10%, and it will increase by 5-10% in summer, causing droughts and floods.</li>
             <li>Increasing diseases: The increase in temperature leads to an increase in the probability of diseases such as encephalitis, dengue fever, and asthma.</li>
